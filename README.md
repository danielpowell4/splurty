# SPLURTY by Dan

## Overview
This is a simple rails app that pulls a random quote from the db and displays it
on the root index page. It was done as part of [TheFirehoseProject](//thefirehoseproject.com)

## See it in action
### In the wild
If you want to experience the app as it stands currently, check it out [here](http://splurty-dan-pow.herokuapp.com/)

### Locally
If you are wanting to make changes or build from this basic app, clone it down,
run a `bundle install` and `rails s` a local server to your desired port. While
doing so go through the motions to ensure your db is set up as desired

## Adding a quote
A quote can be added by clicking the "Contribute" button in the top nav
Once a quote is added it will then join the pool of randomly pulled quotes
